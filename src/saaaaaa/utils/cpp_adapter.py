DEPRECATED: CPP Adapter (Compatibility Wrapper)

This module provides backward compatibility for code using the old CPPAdapter name.
All functionality has been moved to spc_adapter.py with the SPCAdapter class.

CPP (Canon Policy Package) has been renamed to SPC (Smart Policy Chunks).
Please update your imports to use SPCAdapter from spc_adapter.

This wrapper will be removed in a future version.
